### About this project

With the COVID-19 crisis, and the quarantine we face, to avoid getting contaminated with the coronavirus, it's important to follow the WHO recommendations, and one of the most important things is to keep your hands clean. A [video from Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LKVUarhtvE) shows that soap and water is enough to clean your hands, but you have to do it properly, which means:

- Wet your hands;

- Spread soap all over your hands;

- Wash them for at least 20 seconds;

But the human brain isn't very good at tracking the correct time, and that's when I though on developing a device that could track the time without one having to touch it. using the ultrasound sensor with Arduino, this project aims to help you manage your time while washing your hands, to make sure you got rid of the viruses on your hands.
