### About this project

With the COVID-19 crises, and the quarantine we're put under, to avoid getting contaminated, one of the most important things is to keep your hands clean. A [video from Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LKVUarhtvE) shows that soap and water is enough to clean your hands, but you have to do it properly, that means:

- Wet your hands;

- Spread soap all over your hands;

- Wash it for at least 20 seconds;

I realised that our notion of time isn't very precise, and I was thinking about a device that could start without one having to touch it. That's when I thought about using the ultrasound sensor with Arduino. This project helps you manage your time while washing your hands, to make sure you got rid of the viruses.
