### About this project

With the COVID-19 crisis and the quarantine we face, to avoid getting infected with the coronavirus, it's important to follow the [World Health Organization recommendations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public), and one of the most important things to do is to keep your hands clean. A [video from Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LKVUarhtvE) shows how soap and water is enough to clean your hands, if done properly, which means:

- Wet your hands;

- Spread soap all over your hands;

- Wash them for at least 20 seconds;

However the human brain isn't a very good counter, so we usually stop washing our hands before the 20 seconds. That's why I thought on developing a device that could count the time for you without one having to touch it (to avoid the contamination). Using the ultrasonic sensor with Arduino, this project aims to help you manage your time while washing your hands, to make sure you got rid of the viruses.
